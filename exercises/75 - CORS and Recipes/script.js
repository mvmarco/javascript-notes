/* 
  the browser blocked the fetchRecipes, throwing an error because of CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing.
  
  CROSS ORIGIN (DOMAIN NAMES): 

  mvmarco.com (my website)
  ðŸ‘†
  NO NO NO (by default you are not allowed to share data between origins/domain names)
  ðŸ‘‡
  facebook.com or danskebank.dk or recipes.com

  you are allowed to share data from github.com to github.com/about. You are allowed to grab data from 
  other parts of your website. But as soon as you go "cross origin" from one domain name to another
  domain name then you start getting in trouble. Because there are security issues in the browser.
  Like for instance if you are trying to get data from a bank from your personal website is kind of
  a security issue. By default wesites cannot talk from one domain name to another domain name.

  if I wanna take some recipes from a website and put it on my own, we need to be able to talk from
  the recipe website to mine. What needs to happen is that the recipe website has to implent something
  called a "CORS policy". Which something that must happen on the server, nothing that you can do in
  the browser. The "CORS policy" says something like okay, mvmarco.com, is allowed to ask for data and
  we will return it, that is safe. So basically the recipe website has to say "okay these are the domain
  names that are allow to transfer data from my website to theirs". This has to happen on the server of
  the person that has the data.
