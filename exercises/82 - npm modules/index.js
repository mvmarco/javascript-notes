// #################################
// STEPS FOR PACKAGE JSON AND PARCEL
// #################################

/* 
  1. "npm init" created the package.json directory
  2. "npm install parcel-bundler -D"  install parcel and put the web dependency (with shortcut)
      it creates also a "node_modules" folder with around 500 files. What happens is that parcel
      has dependencies itself, little packages that it needs in order for it to work. It is always
      fine to delete the "node_modules" folder because you can always get it back by installing
      "npm install". The thing is that we want some dependencies in our package.json. 
  3. remove: "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" 
     and add: "start": "parcel index.html" necessary to run parcel
  4. in order to avoid any errors from the browser when we use async-await we could put:
     "browserslist": ["last 1 chrome versions"]
  5. run "npm start", in case of error cancel "cache" and "dist" and run again "npm start"

// #################################
// INSTALLING OTHER DEPENDENCIES
// #################################

/* 
  to install other depencies like "faker", "date-fns", "await-to-js", "lodash", "axios"
  we can install them all together by putting a space between them as follow:
  "npm i faker date-fns await-to-js lodash axios" and then "npm start"

// INSTALLING OTHER
// #################################

/* 
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/waait this is the function we wrote all the time:

  const wait = (amount = 0) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, amount));

  we could install it separetely with "npm i waait" and again "npm start"

  in the doc the function and how to import it is:

  import wait from 'waait';

  async function doStuff() {
    doSomething();
    await wait();
    doSomethingElse();
    await wait(200);
    console.log('200ms later');
  }

  so we can create a function as follow and import the "wait" with any name as it is a default
  export. This is the smallest idea of what a package does, as small as a little function.
*/

import wait from 'waait';

async function go() {
  console.log('Going');
  await wait(200);
  console.log('ending');
}

go();
