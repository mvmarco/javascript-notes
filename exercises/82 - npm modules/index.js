/* 
  1. "npm init" created the package.json directory
  2. "npm install parcel-bundler -D"  install parcel and put the web dependency (with shortcut)
      it creates also a "node_modules" folder with around 500 files. What happens is that parcel
      has dependencies itself, little packages that it needs.
