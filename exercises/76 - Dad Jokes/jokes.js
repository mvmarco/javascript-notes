    THIS ERROR HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.  
    what it says is that we have been returned some HTML likely because it returns an open angle
    braket "<" and while it's going to parse that JSON, it realize that it's not JSON but
    HTML. The way to check is going to "network" under "name" find the "request" and by clicking
    you see that it is just an HTML document that came back.

    The way to solve it is to pass on check a second object to fetch, check line 20.
    That object takes in a key "headers": {} which has another object as value.

    stop ----- the documentation in fact says: "All API endpoints follow their respective 
    browser URLs, but we adjust the response formatting to be more suited for an API based
    on the provided HTTP Accept header."

    continue ----- in fact inside the "headers": {} we put Accept: 'application/json'
    because the API says that you can add one of these typologies:

    Accepted Accept headers:

    1 text/html - HTML response (default response format)
    2 application/json - JSON response
    3 text/plain - Plain text response
