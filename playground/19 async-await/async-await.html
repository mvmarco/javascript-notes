  /* 
    "Async" "await" are a way to improve the syntax of promises, the new promises
    syntax allow us to use a much nicer and cleaner way of writing promises
  */

/* 
    // same as usual wait function
    function wait(ms = 0) {
      return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(resolve, ms);
      });
    }
    if we want to use the "async" "await" syntax there are a couple of things that needs
    to happen:
    
    1st you can only use "async" "await" inside of a function that is marked as "async"
    if you have the followin function: you get first starting, then go and then you wait
    
    function go() {
      console.log('starting');
      wait(2000)
      console.log('ending');
    }
    
    but if you do: 
    
    async function go() {
      console.log('starting');
      await wait(2000)
      console.log('ending');
    }
    
    you get starting, you wait e sec and then you get ending.
    and you are able to stick "async" "await"
    however you want:
    
    async function go() {
      console.log('starting');  // run 1st
      await wait(2000)          // waits 2 seconds
      console.log('running');   // run 2nd
      await wait(2000)          // waits 2 more seconds
      console.log('ending');    // run last
    }
    
    you can use "async" and "await" with any type of functions:
    
    // function declaration:  async funtion fd() {};
    // arrow function: const arrowFn = async () => {}
    // callback functions: window.addEventListener('click', async funtion() {})
    // methods: const person = {
      sayHi: async function() {
        
      },
    }
    // function properties: const person = {
      sayHi: async function() {
        
      },
      sayHey: async () => {
        
      },
    }
    
    essentially when you have a function you gotta just put the word "async" in front
    and that will let you do "await"
    
    the only thing you cannot do is what reffered to as "top level await":
    Top-level await enables developers to use the await keyword outside of async functions.
    but does not workkkkkkk - so avoid it.

  // same as usual wait function
  function wait(ms = 0) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(resolve, ms);
    });
  }
  async function go() {
    console.log('Starting');
    await wait(2000);
    console.log('running');
    await wait(200);
    console.log('ending');
  }

  go();
  
// another example

  function makePizza(toppings = []) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      // reject if people try with pineapple
      if (toppings.includes('pineapple')) {
        // eslint-disable-next-line prefer-promise-reject-errors
        reject('Seriously? Get out 🍍');
      }
      const amountOfTimeToBake = 500 + toppings.length * 200;
      // wait 1 second for the pizza to cook:
      setTimeout(function () {
        // when you are ready, you can resolve this promise
        resolve(`Here is your pizza 🍕 with the toppings ${toppings.join(' ')}`);
      }, amountOfTimeToBake);
      // if something went wrong, we can reject this promise;
    });
  }

  async function makeDinnerExample() {
    const pizza1 = makePizza(['pepperoni']);
    console.log(pizza1); // here we get a promise and not the value
  }

  makeDinnerExample();

  /* 
    if you want the actual data  that comes back from a promise (without the usage of .then)
    you must "await" it.

    if you just run the function and store it into a variable, that will store the promise 
    into a variable. But if we put the await in front of the function it will run the 
    "make pizza" function, then wait. The reason why it is it "await" and not just wait 
    it is because is "asynchronously waiting" meaning that its not going to actually
    pause all JavaScript, it is not going to block all the rest of JavaScript on the
    page from running so if I were to run both go() and make dinner() at the same time they
    will not interfere with each other. It is just that they do not interfere with each other
    just the speficic function will temporarly pause. So we are asynchronously waiting for the
    pizza to be done and we will simply console.log it. 
  */

  async function makeDinnerExampleTwo() {
    const pizza1 = await makePizza(['pepperoni']);
    console.log(pizza1); // here we get a promise and the value thanks to await
  }

  makeDinnerExampleTwo();
  
  // similarly we can do:

  async function makeDinner1() {
    const pizza1 = await makePizza(['pepperoni']);
    console.log(pizza1);
    const pizza2 = await makePizza(['mushrooms']);
    console.log(pizza2);
  }

  makeDinner1(); // each of them will take their own amount time and run

  /* 
    now the question is: how do I wait to both to be done? the above code is kind of inefficient
    and it is referred to as "footgun" where if you give somebody the tools to do this it's
    possible that you could make code that is not permormant meaning that, if I make a
    "pepperoni" and "mushroom" pizza I am totally waiting for the "pepperoni" to be created,
    baked and taken out before I even start making the next pizza ("mushroom") and it is 
    likely that you could make both of them at the same time or "concurrently" so what we could
    do is instead of running, waiting for one, and then moving onto the next line and making
    the next one we will:
    1 remove teh await from both of them
    2 add the word promise to each of them
    3 make a big promise we can await
    check below:

  */

  async function makeDinner() {
    const pizzaPromise1 = makePizza(['pepperoni']);
    const pizzaPromise2 = makePizza(['mushrooms']);
    const [pep, mush] = await Promise.all([pizzaPromise1, pizzaPromise2]);
    console.log(pep, mush);
  }

  makeDinner();
