    // IMPORTANT: check the list of all the popular APIs here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

    /* 
      API: application, programming, interface - a way to talk with a machine in a more standardized
      procedure. 

      any type of app, that app, the client, the browser that needs to talk to the server that exists
      somewhere and get data from an API. You can either push or pull data from an API.

      Here we check how to pull data and display it, from a website that offers an API: url that you can
      it with some associated data. That API responds with a JSON: JavaScript Object Notation. A way
      to transport JavaScript Objects from server to server or from server to client. And to see the data.

      if you click the RAW version from an API in JSON viewer, you copied and pasted it (`in backticks`)
      into a variable (lets say "data" = ...), you see a huge string (no matter if inside you see 
      an object inside, it is still a string. so you cannot do string.something). 
      Baically, a server wil just give you a string and it is up to us
      to convert it into a JSON (a JavaScript Object) - and we do it with "JSON.parse(data)" so that
      now we can call as an example: theObjectFromApi.name or theObjectFromApi.companyName etc etc

      A lot of APIs will allow you to pull data from their server into your own, there are many
      that do not allow it and that require API keys to controll over you. What we check here are
      the "wide-open APIs" the ones that do not require any authentication.

      Another thing, if you hear "AJAX". "AJAX" stands for: Asynchronous, JavaScript And Xml.
      The Xml is another way that you can receive data. Not common. Looks like HTML but it is not,
      it is quite unlickely to work with it. People just using AJAX as a word when they mean  to
      fetching data from an API and displaying it on the page.

    // FIRST STEP
    // #######################

    /* 
      the first step, not mandatory but more easy, is put the url into a variable.
      sometimes is referred to "endpoint" just a fancy way to refer to the URL that you
      need to visit in order to get the data. So just a nice way to say, it is not a simple URL

      does not matter if the URL is in backticks or double/single string. In case you gotta
      interpolate the username, in this case, coming from a different const. Then you gotta 
      use backticks on the URL for interpolate
    */

    const endpoint = 'https://api.github.com/users/mvmarco';
    const userElementParagraph = document.querySelector('.user');

    // #########################################
    // SECOND STEP: GET THE DATA: FETCH OR AXIOS
    // #########################################

    /* 
      now in order to get the data we use a library present in the browser called: "fetch"
      there are also other libraries that are used such as "Axios". Fetch is very good and used in
      all browser. We use that one here.
    */

    // here you can display some text before we fetch the data from the user: below makes more sense
    userElementParagraph.textContent = 'Loading......';
    const marcoPromise = fetch(endpoint); // fetch means retrieval of data - it is a browser method
    console.log(marcoPromise);

    /* 
      after console.log(marcoPromise)
      if you go to network, refresh, you see all the request happened on the page, including the data
      now we gotta take that data and convert it into JavaScript with .then and .catch

      .catch is for the handeError function because debugging APIs is hard, and id you don't have
      a proper error handing setup is even harder
    */

    function handleError(err) {
      console.log('OH NOOOOOO');
      console.log(err);
    }

    marcoPromise
      .then((response) => {
        console.log(response); // which is not our final data, we need to:
        return response.json(); // which will convert the response in JSON, but it is another promise
      })
      .then((data) => {
        console.log(data);
        console.log(data.blog);
        console.log(data.name);
        console.log(data.location);
        userElementParagraph.textContent = `${data.name} - ${data.blog} - ${data.location}`;
      })
