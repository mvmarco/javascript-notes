      "bind", "call" and "apply" are function used to change the scope of what "this" is

      but many people do and some tricky interview questions focus on this topic

      that they look to the left of the dot and see what they are bound against. As result you get
      the result of the function on that method: "hey Marco"


      so now if we are gonna take the sayHi() method and put it outside in its own variable
      so it is defined outside:
    */

      when you will console.log(sayHi) you will get:

      Æ’ sayHi() {
        console.log(`hey this is ${this.name}`);
        return `hey ${this.name}`;
      }

      in other words the property of that "person object", which is a function itself
      and you will store it into the variable sayHi
    */
    console.log(sayHi);
    
    /*
      but now the crack is that when in the console we do: sayHi()  
      as result we just get:  "hey " 
      because person.sayHi (the property which is a function) is stored inside a variable 
      and we are just calling it, the "this" is not bound to anything. it is just a property
      stored into a variable, there is not an object associated or "bind" to. 
    */

    // another example: if you do save person.sayHi() in another const:
    const sayHi2 = person.sayHi();

    /* 
      the sayHi2 variable will store inside the returned value of the sayHi function 
      inside the person object ( person.sayHi() will call the function 
      and return the value inside of the function) so now when you will console.log(sayHi2)
      you will get: "hey Marco"  
      
      which is the stored result of the function/method: "hey Marco"
    */

    console.log(sayHi2);

    /* 
      now when you in the console do: sayHi() you get undefined, it says that sayHi() is not a function.
      because for the browser now sayHi() does not exist as a function and you cannot call it.
      The only thing that exist is the result of the sayHi() function, which is stored into 
      the variable sayHi2. 
      
      sayHi() is now bounded to the window, if exists
      
      
    */

    /*
      the "this" keyword is only defined where the function is being called
      and not where the function has been defined. So even though we defined the sayHi() 
      function inside of an object, it is not bound it unless we call it as a method of an
      object -> like person.sayHi()

      what we can do is use the "bind" keyword to change where the "this" keyword is
      defined. In other words, the "bind" keyword is used to change what actually
      the "this" keyword is equal to or bound to.

      so if we do:

      const sayHi = person.sayHi.bind(person);

      what you do is, taking the person property, which is function, and associate that
      function to the "object person" otherwise the property/function is not associated to 
      nothing. and store this function associated to the object into a variable called sayHi.
      
      In other words, "this" will now be referred to something, the "person" passed in the bind() 
      function. Which is an object by the way.

      so now if we run in the console: sayHi() we get "hey Marco" 

      it works because we changed what "this" is equal to by binding to an object.
      So why would that be useful? because sometimes we want to use a method
      of an object with some other informations. Example below:
      
      The bind() method allows an object to borrow a method from another object without
      making a copy of that method. This is known as function borrowing in JavaScript.
    */

    // how would I use the sayHi() method for another object such as Jenna?
    const person2 = {
      name: 'Marco',
      sayHi() {
        console.log(this); // this will log all the properties of the person object, property and function
        console.log(`hey this is ${this.name}`); // this will log this string
        return `hey ${this.name}`; // this will return the string
      },
    };
    
    const jenna = { name: 'Jenna' };
    // the solution would be to bind the sayHi() to jenna

    // you the property/function of the person2 and associate it to a another object
    const sayHi3 = person2.sayHi.bind(jenna);
    console.log(sayHi3); // this will run "hey Jenna"

    /* 
      sayHi is a function/property while bind() is method that lives inside any functions
      and says change the "this" keyword to what there is inside of that object that you pass
    */

    // if you have this costant:
    const $ = document.querySelector;
    /* 
      and in the console you run: $ 
      you get the same result as running: document.querySelector
      it is the same exact thing: document.querySelector === $    
      which returns: true 
    */
    console.log('check what it is', $); // you just see native code which is a bunch of built JS stuff
    /* 
      above this page we have paragraph, if in the console you do:

      $('p'); you get error, because first you store document.querySelector which is a 
      function/property of the document inside a variable, which has a bunch of prebuilt native
      JS stuff. So the variable carries only the function/property it is not really
      associated to anything.
      
      somewhere under the hood in querySelector needs to know
      where to look for the thing you are selecting (like the document). So if we
      have the wrapper class we can search it in the document and use the wrapper
      to search the paragrap as follow:
    */

    const wrapper = document.querySelector('.wrapper');
    const p = wrapper.querySelector('p');
    console.log(p);
    /*
      so querySelector is a function/property of the document that needs to know where 
      should look inside for the selector. This can be globally
      with the document or in a subset of the dom which is the wrapper, then it knows
      to look inside of the wrapper because the querySelector says "this" which will be equal
      either to the wrapper.

      but the resons why $.('p') is not working is because we somehow have taken away 
      the object which the method was called against and it is not bound to anything 
    */

    /* 
      the way we fix that is with the usage of "bind" and then we manually pass reference
      to the thing we want "this" to be equal to. by calling bind against querySelector, 
      we say when the $2 function is run, use `document` as the `this` value. so basically
      you associated the "this" value to a variable, because the method is not called directly
      to that variable.
    */
    const $2 = document.querySelector.bind(document);
    const lookFor = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document);
    console.log($2('p')); // here find the p in the document
    console.log(lookFor('p')); // here you get a nodelist with 2 paragraps/element

    /* 
      last time "bind" will change the context of what the "this" keyword is bind to or equal to.
      Another thing that "bind" is used for is to prep a function that has arguments, sort of
      preloaded or batteries included
    */

    // ############################

    const bill = {
      total: 1000,
      calculate(taxRate) {
        console.log(this);
        return this.total + this.total * taxRate;
      },
    };
    
    // here you console log the result of the returned function
    const total = bill.calculate(0.13);
    console.log(total); // it works you get: 1130

    // now if we want to store the calculate function into another variable
    const calc = bill.calculate.bind({ total: 500 }, 0.06); // 0.06 is the taxt rate (argument)
    console.log(calc());

    /* 
      you can also pass the arguments of the method of the object
      directly when you call the function: console.log(calc(0.15)); for example

      if a method has multiple arguments:

      const bill = {
        total: 1000,
        calculate(taxRate, tiRate, blablablabla) {
          console.log(this);
          return this.total + this.total * taxRate;
        },
      };
      

      you can just pass them following the order of them when creating a new binded variable

      const calculation = bill.calculate.bind({total: 1000},taxRate, tiRate, blablablabla);
      console.log(calculation());
      
      Now what is this helpful? because sometimes when you are generating functions, and you
      need to loop over a list of data, you have access to that data at the time of the function
      creation and maybe later you wanna call it. And sometimes it is easier to go batteries 
      included on the binded function / example bill.calculate.apply({ total: 325 }, [0.6]); /
      pass what the argumetn will be at the call time, when you are binding it and then you can
      kind of like that function wherever you want and knowing that the arguments/batteries
      are pre installed on it and you can go ahead and call it whenever you want
    */
