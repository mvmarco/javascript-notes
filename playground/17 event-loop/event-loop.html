    /* 
      the first thing to understand before passing to promises, we need to talk about
      how JavaScript is Asynchronous and how the event loop works. Sometimes we hear
      that almost everything in JavaScript is "Asynchronus" or "non-blocking". In order
      to understand what that means, we need to talk about how JavaScript events work.

      Javascript is a single threaded language. Which means, that only do one thing/only
      run one thing at the time. it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code
      before moving onto the next. Some other languages are multi threaded, meaning that they
      can run multiple processes at once. But JavaScript is single threaded, meaning that we can
      run what thing at once.
    */

    console.log('starting'); // this run 1st
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('running'); // this run 3rd
    }, 2000);
    console.log('ending'); // this run 2nd

    /* 
      so as we can see they do not run in the order we put them or code them in.
      So it will not first do the "starting", then wait 2 seconds and do the "running"
      and then do the "ending". But instead, what JS will do is: parsing "starting",
      then it will parse the next couple of lines the "running". Notice that there is a
      callback, and pin it a side and come back in two second. And then it goes again
      and run the "ending". What happens next is, two seconds later what comes back is
      the call back that has been queued up. And it will run it for us. That is what is
      referred to as the "call-stack": https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack
      for more infos. "call-stack" and the "event-loop" is a pretty complicated thing to understand it
      so to understand it properly watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ


      if you go to: http://latentflip.com/loupe/?code=JC5vbignYnV0dG9uJywgJ2NsaWNrJywgZnVuY3Rpb24gb25DbGljaygpIHsKICAgIHNldFRpbWVvdXQoZnVuY3Rpb24gdGltZXIoKSB7CiAgICAgICAgY29uc29sZS5sb2coJ1lvdSBjbGlja2VkIHRoZSBidXR0b24hJyk7ICAgIAogICAgfSwgMjAwMCk7Cn0pOwoKY29uc29sZS5sb2coIkhpISIpOwoKc2V0VGltZW91dChmdW5jdGlvbiB0aW1lb3V0KCkgewogICAgY29uc29sZS5sb2coIkNsaWNrIHRoZSBidXR0b24hIik7Cn0sIDUwMDApOwoKY29uc29sZS5sb2coIldlbGNvbWUgdG8gbG91cGUuIik7!!!PGJ1dHRvbj5DbGljayBtZSE8L2J1dHRvbj4%3D
      you can test the process described above, essentially there are three boxes.


      the "call-stack"                                     This is are things that are waiting
      is what actually JavaScript is                       or things that we are listening for
      doing or running                                     such as event handlers, timers etc.
      ------------------------------------                 ------------------------------------
      |                                  |                 |                                  |
      |              CALL-STACK          |                 |            WEB APIs              |
      |                                  |                 |                                  |
      ------------------------------------                 ------------------------------------  
      
      When a click button has finished it 
      or a timer it will be stick into the "call-back queue"
      and sent to the "callstack" when there is nothing else left there
      ------------------------------------
      |                                  |
      |           CALLBACK QUEUE         |
      |                                  |
      ------------------------------------

      in the tool loupe, you can sort of visualize the "call-stack". In general the "call-stack"
      will show you, when you click something, which functions where called upon that. 
      And we know that the "call-stack" will only run one function at the time, but there are
      situations where the functions are running in other spefic moments. That is also why
      JavaScript is referred as "asynchronous". Which means that is not going to stop
      the function that needs more time, but instead put in what is called "web apis". Then it
      will be put in the "call-back queue" and run in the "call-stack" if there is nothing
      before it.

      even if you put 0 milliseconds on the following code lines it will be following the same
      process:

      console.log('starting'); // this run 1st
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('running'); // this run 3rd because it will be added on the "web apis"
      }, 0);
      console.log('ending'); // this run 2nd
      

      so it sounds simple but it goes at deep level, as beginner-mid-level you just have to understand
      that JavaScript is a "single-threaded" language. Which means, that only run one thing at the time.
      and if it has to run multiple things queued up this is obviusly slowing down.

      the question is how do we deal with this that takes time, like going off grap some data from an
      API and come back to it, we should be able to don't freeze up the intere browser. What we want
      to do is fetch, get that data and carry on the rest of our life. And when that data comes to
      us we can deal to it. Like the setTimeOut(), when the timer is done we can come back and deal
      with it.

      so callback are great but it is difficult to orchestrate multiple things at once, here below an
      example. Where we have to deal with stuff in sequence, it is common in JS:
    */

    /*
      above there is a div with a class="go";
    */
    // 1. Make a DIV and change the text to GO when clicked.
    const go = document.querySelector('.go');
    go.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
      const el = event.currentTarget;
      console.log(el);
      el.textContent = 'go';
      // 2. Make it a circle after 2 seconds
      setTimeout(() => {
        el.classList.add('circle');
        console.log('making it CIRCLE');
        // 3. Make it red after 0.5s
        setTimeout(() => {
          el.classList.add('red');
          console.log('making it RED');
          // 4. after it is a circle make it square again after 0.25s
          setTimeout(() => {
            el.classList.remove('circle');
            console.log('making it SQUARE');
            // 5. make it purple after 0.3 second
            setTimeout(() => {
              // el.classList.remove('red');
              el.classList.add('purple');
              console.log('making it PURPLE');
              // 6. fade out after 0.5s
              setTimeout(() => {
                el.classList.add('fadeOut');
              }, 500);
            }, 300);
          }, 250);
        }, 500);
      }, 2000);
    });

    /* 
      this is awful and it is what is referred to "call-back hell" and "call-back hell" is
      if you need to do thing one after another you must nest the call-back inside each other
      because they all depend on the previous call-back to being called before they can be
      go ahead and run. The example is easy but you end up with a christmas three code, and it is
      not the best practice. the solution to "call-back hell" is "promise-land", using "promises".
      "promises" allow us to write code that is much easier to look at and flatter. The path
      from "call-back hell" to the "promise-land" is mentioned on the next folder n. 18.
