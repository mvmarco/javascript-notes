// ############################
// OBJECTS
// ############################

/* 

everything in JS is an object. Objects allow us to group together properties (or keys) and values.
the function is to store data or create a custom type. What is important is that object are used where
the order of property does not matter. Never rely on the order of the property in an object to be 
mainteined in the same way. Different browser have different orders.

the object literal syntax convention to write object is: 

const person = {
  age: 100,
  name: 'marco',
};

property on the left and value on the right. The value can be any type (number, boolean, numbers
variables, arrays a etc etc check the lesson types)

// as mentioned above you can also pass a vaiable as an object

const age = 100;
const person = {
  age = age,
  name: 'marco',
};

// if you pass a variable with the same name as the value you can just do:

const age = 100;
const person = {
  age,
  name: 'marco',
};


// if you wanna include a property with dashes or number or spaces has to be passed as a string
the console will read is a property. Otherwise wont work. you cannot have variables with dashes
but you can have properties. Also as mentioned you cannot trust the order, in fact 777 in the console
will be on top. NEVER TRUST THE ORDER. ALWAYS PUT THE COMMA ALSO ON THE LAST ONE, GOOD PRACTICE

const age = 100;
const person = {
  age,
  name: 'marco',
  '777': true, // the number will be corrected without a string
  'really cool': false,
  'test-property-with-dash': 'testing',
};

console.log(person);
*/

// we can also add sub-properties with an object nested inside the main object
// we can also add functions
const age = 100;
const wes = {
  age,
  name: 'wes',
  properyToCheck: 'NEVER',
  'cool-dude': true,
  'really cool': false,
  777: true,
  dog: 'snicker',
  // sub-properties with an object
  clothing: {
    shirts: 10,
    pants: 2,
  },
  // functions properties or methods. it is not an arrow function
  sayHello(greeting = 'Hey') {
    return `${greeting} ${this.name}`;
  },
};

// ############################
// ACCESS PROPERTIES
// ############################

// how to add new property or update
wes.job = 'Web Developer';
wes.age = 50; // age is a costant but you can update its value and not create another age const. That is what costants are
console.log(wes.clothing);
// you can also go deeper in the nested object
console.log(wes.clothing.shirts);
console.log(wes); // you get the whole object

/*
you can also access properties with
console.log(wes['age']);
but prettier fix it: console.log(wes.age);

but it is for explaining that if you do:
*/

// const propertyToCheck = prompt('What do you wanna check');

/* 
it will replace the input string of the prompt with whatever property you have in wes
it means that strings are converted in properties
you use square brakets when the property to check is an input from the user for instance
and you are not sure what that would be
or when you have to console.log the properties with custom names '777' or 'cool-dude' or 'really cool'


console.log(wes[propertyToCheck]);
console.log(wes['777']); // for number it works also without  quotes: 777
console.log(wes['really cool']);

*/

// ############################
// ACCESS PROPERTIES: FREEZE
// ############################

/*

there is a way of let an object stays with its properties and dont let anyone change them
the way is to use freeze.

const wesFroze = Object.freeze(wes)

now if you go in the console and try to update: wesFroze.age = 100
calling wesFroze will tell you again that the age is 50

*/

// #####################################
// CHECKING IF PROPERTIES ARE PRESENT
// #####################################

const nameInput = document.querySelector('[name="first"]');
const name = nameInput ? nameInput.value : '';
console.log(name);

// ############################
// DELETE PROPERTIES
// ############################

/* 
to delete properties you can use the delete keyword before the property you wanna delete
you can either store it in a variable or in a console.log to check if the result of
deletion is true or false:

console.log(delete wes.job); 

if you just call wes.job in the console will be undefined

This does not mean that if you do:

// wes.age = undefined; 
// wes.age = null;

you will delete them, but instead means you just update their value and they are still present
*/

// ############################
// METHODS
// ############################

// methods are functions that lives inside of an object

/* 

const wes = {
  age,
  name: 'wes',
  //  methods
  sayHello(greeting = 'Hey') {
    return `${greeting} ${this.name}`;
  },
};

if in the console you do wes.sayHello you get 'Hey wes'
this refers to what is before the dot which is wes

you use the word this to refer to the main object name and if you have multiple
objects you can just use this instead writing the name wes.name and another name and another name
for each main objects 

arrow function dont have access to this, but instead the parent element will inherit 
automatically the this, but you can do this:

const wes = {
  age,
  name: 'wes',
  //  methods
  sayHello: (greeting = 'Hey') => {
    return `${greeting} ${name}`;
  },
};


in sum when you have a function that lives inside of an objects that is what is referred as a method


*/

// ############################
// OBJECT REFERENCE VS VALUES
// ############################

let name1 = 'wes';
let name2 = 'wes';

console.log(name1 === name2); // we get true
name1 = 'scott';
console.log(name1 === name2); // we get false

// update name1 to be what is name2
name1 = name2;
console.log(name1 === name2); // we get true
name2 = name1;
console.log(name1 === name2); // we get true
name2 = 'westopher'; // name1 is still wes

/* 
one equal is just update the left value with the value of the right one. 
Without changing the right value. For objects is as follow: 

const person1 = {
  first: 'wes',
  last: 'bos',
};

const person2 = {
  first: 'wes',
  last: 'bos',
};

console.log(person1 === person2);  // we get false 

We get false because when we compare objects we reference the object itself
and not the values inside of it. If there are two separate objects even though 
they may have the same content inside. They are still different. So it is different
than a string, because a string can only have a value while objects have multiple.
No matter if two objects have the same values, objects are different.


if we do:
const person3 = person1;
person3.first = 'Larry';
console.log(person3.first); // we get Larry
console.log(person1.first); // we get Larry 

if we do person3.last = 'Cool'
also the person1.last will be equal to 'Cool'

this is because objects and array are copied by reference which means
that when we did const person3 = person1; we are taking a variable (person3)
that reference to the original one (person1) instead of making a copy of it

so if you wanna take a copy of another object you can with the spread

person3.first = 'Larry';
