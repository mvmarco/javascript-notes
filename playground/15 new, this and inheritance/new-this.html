      classes, prototypes, new and this keyword are all connected and defined as the foundation of
      what is called object oriented programming - the other popular version is functional programming:

      Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses a different method for storing 
      and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects
      and it can only be transformed by creating functions.
      In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects.
