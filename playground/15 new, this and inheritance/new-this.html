      classes, prototypes, new and this keyword are all connected and defined as the foundation of
      what is called object oriented programming - the other popular version is functional programming:

      Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses a different method for storing 
      and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects
      and it can only be transformed by creating functions.
      In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects.

    const myDate = new Date('August 11, 2025');
    console.log(myDate);
    console.dir(myDate); // you see there are a lot of methods inside
    console.log(myDate.getFullYear); // you get 2025

    /* 
      so the question is from where this methods are coming from?
      same as the arrays have all the methods: pop, push, slice, splice
      but where do they come from?

      it is because when you create a date you create an object, as well as
      when you create an array or a string. We create a new object in JS.

      the types in itself typed in the console are essentialy functions:
      Array, Object, Date, Numbers are all functions that when they are run
      with the New keyword they become object. That is why in JS we say that
      everything is an object.

      when you create a new number:

      const myNumber = new Number(100)
      you can see that: myNumber has a bunch of methos in the proto
