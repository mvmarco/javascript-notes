      classes, prototypes, new and this keyword are all connected and defined as the foundation of
      what is called object oriented programming - the other popular version is functional programming:

      Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses a different method for storing 
      and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects
      and it can only be transformed by creating functions.
      In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects.

    const myDate = new Date('August 11, 2025');
    console.log(myDate);
    console.dir(myDate); // you see there are a lot of methods inside
    console.log(myDate.getFullYear); // you get 2025

    /* 
      so the question is from where this methods are coming from?
      same as the arrays have all the methods: pop, push, slice, splice
      but where do they come from?

      it is because when you create a date you create an object, as well as
      when you create an array or a string. We create a new object in JS.

      the types in itself typed in the console are essentialy functions:
      Array, Object, Date, Numbers are all functions that when they are run
      with the New keyword they become object. That is why in JS we say that
      everything is an object.

      when you create a new number:

      const myNumber = new Number(100)
      you can see that: myNumber has a bunch of methos in the proto
    */
    
    /*     
      coming back to  const myDate = new Date('August 11, 2025');
      myDate is an instace of Date
      in fact if you do 'typeof myDate' you get "object" because date is an Object
      and if you do 'myDate instanceof Date' you get "true" 
    */

    // another example
    const names = ['wes', 'kate'];
    console.log(names);
    /* 
      if you do 'typeof names' in the console you get
      "object" because an array is not a type but a special kind of an object
      but if you do 'names istanceof Array' you get "true"
    */

    /* 
      can be confusing because usually you do not use the "new" keyword while
      creating an array or an object: 
      const names = ['wes', 'kate'];
      const wes = {name: 'wes', age: 100};
      because the parentesis like [] or {} are defined as literal sintax
      and it the same one as:
      const names = new Array('wes', 'kate');
      const wes = new Object({name: 'wes', age: 100});

      Date does not have a literal sintax so you gotta use the "new" keyword
    */

    // another example is:

    const span = document.createElement('span');
    console.log(span);

    /* 
      if you do 'span instance of Element' you get "true"
      span is an instanceof an element but we do not use the word "new"
      because document.createElement() use the "new" keyword under the hood
    */

    // practice:

    const Pizza = () => console.log('making a pizza');
    const pepperoniPizza = Pizza();
    console.log(pepperoniPizza); // you get undefined because the pizza function did not return anything

    function Secondpizza() {
      console.log('Making a second pizza');
    }

    const pepperoniPizza2 = new Secondpizza(); // here you get an empty Secondpizza object
    /* 
      in other words when you use the "new" keyword on a function it creates a new instance
      object of that function. In other words, a new object that is an instance of whatever
      function you made it from
    */
    // console.log(pepperoniPizza2);
    // so if you do:
    console.log(pepperoniPizza2.constructor);
    console.log(pepperoniPizza2 instanceof Secondpizza);

    /* 
      Arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. 
      Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword. 
      As such, a prototype property does not exist for an arrow function.

      is implicit. So when you add an eventListener to one of these isntance "buttons"

      onto to the instances. The function itself is called "constructor".

      if we want to count the slices that are left in that pizza we can start with that 
      pizza having 10 slices.

        so the above function works perfectly but there is a downside which is that we are
        actually creating one function for every single pizza is made. So if in the console you
        do: 
        tomatoePizza.eat() === freshNewPizza.eat()  
        you get: false
        
        so what happens is that we are duplicating the functionality of the eat() function
        once for every single pizza, and the function is the same for every single pizza.
        So the function does not have to have its own code for it, like toppings, customer
        id and so on. Because they are essentially different, but the functionality to eat()
        a slice of pizza is the same for each pizza. 

        instead of putting functions of every single pizza instance, we can put them on what
        is referred to PROTOTYPE. The big deal is that if you have 200000000 thousands of pizza
        instances and make a duplicate functions, all the time you duplicate you suck data memory
         if you have thousand thousands of pizza,
